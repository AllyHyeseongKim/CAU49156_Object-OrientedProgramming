# OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming with Polymorphism)
### Project4

Project for Object-Oriented Programming

#### Objective and Functionality
Our project, <b>"Total War: KOREA"</b>, is a console game 4 groups of military forces try to compete over the land of Korea.

<b>The process to execute the exciting game is as follows:</b>
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The player of the game first chooses one of the groups when the game starts and becomes the king of the group. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;There are 4 actions he or she can choose: human resource management, internal affairs, soldier, and war. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The result of the war depends on the level of training of soldiers and the selected hero’s average power(ability).
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the player occupies all the land, eventually, he or she wins the game.

#### Compile and Run
There are multiple ways of running OOPS-Project4

First, you can use <b>CLion (tested on CLion 2019.2)</b> to 'Checkout from Git Repository - Git'.<br>Click ‘run’ on the top right, and you’re done.

Second, you can use <b>bash (tested on macOS 10.15)</b>.<br>Make sure there is a compiler compatible with cmake installed, and cmake is functional / installed.
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Input following commands consecutively.

```
cmake CMakeFiles.txt
make
./main
```

<br>Third, you can use <b>QT (tested on QT 5.12)</b>. Change to 'Release' mode instead of 'Debug' mode.<br>Click 'run' at the bottom left or press the shortcut key, 'Ctrl + R', and you're done.

Fourth, you can use <b>executable file</b>.
