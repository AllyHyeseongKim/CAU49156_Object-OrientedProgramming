Project4 for Object-Oriented Programming

Our project is a console game 4 groups of military forces try to compete over the land of Korea. The process to execute the exciting game is as follows:
	The player of the game first chooses one of the groups when the game starts and becomes the king of the group. There are 4 actions he or she can choose: human resource management, internal affairs, soldier, and war. The result of the war depends on the level of training of soldiers and the selected heroâ€™s average power(ability). If the player occupies all the land, eventually, he or she wins the game.
