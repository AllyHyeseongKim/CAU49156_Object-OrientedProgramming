# OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming with SOLID)
### Project1 (Problem2)

Project for Object-Oriented Programming

#### Objective and Functionality
Student management has never been easier.
This program packs the essentials for efficient student list management.

Users can Add / Edit / Kick students, or view the entire database and search by ID, name, age, and department.
<strike>There is also a hidden feature that probably should NOT be used.</strike>

#### Compile and Run
There are multiple ways of running OOPS-Project1

First, you can use <b>CLion (tested on CLion 2019.2)</b> to 'Checkout from Git Repository - Git'.<br>Click ‘run’ on the top right, and you’re done.

Second, you can use <b>bash (tested on macOS 10.15)</b>.<br>Make sure there is a compiler compatible with cmake installed, and cmake is functional / installed.
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Input following commands consecutively.

```
cmake CMakeFiles.txt
make
./main
```
